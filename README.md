# SDL-Asteroids

A simple version of the classic Asteroids game using the SDL Library, as a learning step towards Game Development. 

The spaceship can be made to face any angle using the `Left` and `Right` arrow keys, and use `Up` and `Down` keys for movement. Use `Space` to shoot lasers.

Below is a snapshot of the program:
